# Hello_World_API
A Simple API made with MongoDB, Node, and Express as taught in the DevSlopes tutorial. Use nodemon to launch the server on port 3000. You can then use GET and POST requests to add cars to the vehicle schema (best if done via Postman).

Tutorial Can be purchased on Udemy. Credit goes to Jack from DevSlopes for teaching this course:
